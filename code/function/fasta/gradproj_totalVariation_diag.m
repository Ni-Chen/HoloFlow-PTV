%   This code uses the gradient projection algorithm of Beck & Teboulle:
%   Beck, A. & Teboulle, M. Fast gradient-based algorithms for
%       constrained total variation image denoising and deblurring
%       problems. IEEE Trans. Image Process. 18, 2419ï¿½2434 (2009).
%  Inputs:
%    im      : An N-D array with noisy image data
%    mu      : A scaling parameter that controls the strength of TV penalty

%  The gradient of an N-dimensional array. The output array has size
%  [size(x) ndims(x)].  Note that this output array has one more dimension
%  that the input array. This array contains all of the partial derivatives
%  (i.e., forward first-order differences) of x.  The partial derivatives
%  are indexed by the last dimension of the returned array.  For example,
%  if x was 3 dimensional, the returned value of g has 4 dimensions.  The
%  x-derivative is stored in g(:,:,:,1), the y-derivative is g(:,:,:,2),
%  and the z-derivative is g(:,:,:,3).
%   Note:  This method uses circular boundary conditions for simplicity.

    shift = [-1, 1, 1];

%  The divergence operator.  This method performs backward differences on
%  the input vector x.  It then sums these differences, and returns an
%  array with 1 dimension less than the input.  Note:  this operator is the
%  adjoint/transpose of "grad."

    shift = -[-1, 1, 1];
